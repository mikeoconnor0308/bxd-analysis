# BXD Analysis
A set of scripts for analysing a BXD trajectory. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/159704268.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/159704268)


## Getting Started

The script `bxd/BXDanalysis.py` can be used to analyse trajectories that use the original implementation of BXD described
by Glowacki et al and implemented in CHARMM.

The script `bxd/MultiBXDAnalysis.py` can be used to analyse trajectories that use the multidimensional BXD implementation
described by [O'Connor et al](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/fd/c6fd00138f).

The jupyter notebook `bxd-analysis-notebook.ipynb` demonstrates how the analysis objects can be used interactively to
compute errors on MFPTs using block analysis.
